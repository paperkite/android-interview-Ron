## Tech challenge for Ron

We would like you to build an app with two screens. The first with three vertically stacked carousel-like components, and the second with a view of your choice. 

At rest the first screen should look like this:

![Alt text](/Challenge.jpeg?raw=true "Challenge")

The user can view the two items before and after the selected item, and swipe through each collection, with paging and smooth transitions. Please ignore the back arrow in the screenshot. 

When the user taps the confirmation button, it will navigate to the second screen to show more details for the selected items.

It would be good if you could architect it in such a way so that in the future the following features can be added:

- The opacity of the items to the left & right of the selected item gradually decrease in a linear manner. 
- The carousels can support custom views. 

For bonus points, integrate an API such as https://thecatapi.com/ to populate one of the carousels. Feel free to replace with an API of your choice.
Please implement MVVM architecture in the Android project by using Kotlin.

Please avoid Android Jetpack Compose and use this repository to submit your answer.

You are encouraged to send any challenge related questions to Chen (chen.chen@paperkite.co.nz) and CC Sonny (Sonny.Gao@paperkite.co.nz) just incase Chen is unavailable.
